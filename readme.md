## Introduction

This work extends [3DDFA](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA), named **3DDFA_V2**, titled [Towards Fast, Accurate and Stable 3D Dense Face Alignment](https://guojianzhu.com/assets/pdfs/3162.pdf), accepted by [ECCV 2020](https://eccv2020.eu/). The supplementary material is [here](https://guojianzhu.com/assets/pdfs/3162-supp.pdf). The [gif](./docs/images/webcam.gif) above shows a webcam demo of the tracking result, in the scenario of my lab. This repo is the official implementation of 3DDFA_V2.

Compared to [3DDFA](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA), 3DDFA_V2 achieves better performance and stability. Besides, 3DDFA_V2 incorporates the fast face detector [FaceBoxes](https://github.com/zisianw/FaceBoxes.PyTorch) instead of Dlib. A simple 3D render written by c++ and cython is also included. This repo supports the onnxruntime, and the latency of regressing 3DMM parameters using the default backbone is about **1.35ms/image on CPU** with a single image as input. If you are interested in this repo, just try it on this **[google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OKciI0ETCpWdRjP-VOGpBulDJojYfgWv)**! Welcome for valuable issues, PRs and discussions 😄

<!-- Currently, the pre-trained model, inference code and some utilities are released.  -->

## Getting started

### Requirements
See [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt), tested on macOS and Linux platforms. The Windows users may refer to [FQA](#FQA) for building issues. Note that this repo uses Python3. The major dependencies are PyTorch, numpy, opencv-python and onnxruntime, etc. If you run the demos with `--onnx` flag to do acceleration, you may need to install `libomp` first, i.e., `brew install libomp` on macOS.

### Usage

1. Clone this repo
   
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2.git
cd 3DDFA_V2
```

2. Build the cython version of NMS, Sim3DR, and the faster mesh render
<!-- ```shell script
cd FaceBoxes
sh ./build_cpu_nms.sh
cd ..

cd Sim3DR
sh ./build_sim3dr.sh
cd ..

# the faster mesh render
cd utils/asset
gcc -shared -Wall -O3 render.c -o render.so -fPIC
cd ../..
```

or simply build them by -->
```shell script
sh ./build.sh
```

3. Run demos

```shell script
# 1. running on still image, the options include: 2d_sparse, 2d_dense, 3d, depth, pncc, pose, uv_tex, ply, obj
python3 demo.py -f examples/inputs/emma.jpg --onnx # -o [2d_sparse, 2d_dense, 3d, depth, pncc, pose, uv_tex, ply, obj]

# 2. running on videos
python3 demo_video.py -f examples/inputs/videos/214.avi --onnx

# 3. running on videos smoothly by looking ahead by `n_next` frames
python3 demo_video_smooth.py -f examples/inputs/videos/214.avi --onnx

# 4. running on webcam
python3 demo_webcam_smooth.py --onnx

# 5. running on webcam with box pose

python3 demo_webcam_smooth.py --onnx --opt box_pose
```

The implementation of tracking is simply by alignment. If the head pose > 90° or the motion is too fast, the alignment may fail. A threshold is used to trickly check the tracking state, but it is unstable.

You can refer to [demo.ipynb](./demo.ipynb) or [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OKciI0ETCpWdRjP-VOGpBulDJojYfgWv) for the step-by-step tutorial of running on the still image.

For example, running `python3 demo.py -f examples/inputs/emma.jpg -o 3d` will give the result below:

### Configs

The default backbone is MobileNet_V1 with input size 120x120 and the default pre-trained weight is `weights/mb1_120x120.pth`, shown in [configs/mb1_120x120.yml](configs/mb1_120x120.yml). This repo provides another config in [configs/mb05_120x120.yml](configs/mb05_120x120.yml), with the widen factor 0.5, being smaller and faster. You can specify the config by `-c` or `--config` option. The released models are shown in the below table. Note that the inference time on CPU in the paper is evaluated using TensorFlow.

| Model | Input | #Params | #Macs | Inference (TF) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| MobileNet  | 120x120 | 3.27M | 183.5M | ~6.2ms |
| MobileNet x0.5 | 120x120 | 0.85M | 49.5M | ~2.9ms |


**Surprisingly**, the latency of [onnxruntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) is much smaller. The inference time on CPU with different threads is shown below. The results are tested on my MBP (i5-8259U CPU @ 2.30GHz on 13-inch MacBook Pro), with the `1.5.1` version of onnxruntime. The thread number is set by `os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"]`, see [speed_cpu.py](./speed_cpu.py) for more details.

| Model | THREAD=1 | THREAD=2 | THREAD=4 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| MobileNet  | 4.4ms  | 2.25ms | 1.35ms |
| MobileNet x0.5 | 1.37ms | 0.7ms | 0.5ms |

### Latency

The `onnx` option greatly reduces the overall **CPU** latency, but face detection still takes up most of the latency time, e.g., 15ms for a 720p image. 3DMM parameters regression takes about 1~2ms for one face, and the dense reconstruction (more than 30,000 points, i.e. 38,365) is about 1ms for one face. Tracking applications may benefit from the fast 3DMM regression speed, since detection is not needed for every frame. The latency is tested using my 13-inch MacBook Pro (i5-8259U CPU @ 2.30GHz).

The default `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is set 4, you can specify it by setting `os.environ['OMP_NUM_THREADS'] = '$NUM'` or inserting `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$NUM` before running the python script.

## FQA

1. What is the training data?

    We use [300W-LP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7OEHD3T4eCkVGs0TkhUWFN6N1k/view?usp=sharing) for training. You can refer to our [paper](https://guojianzhu.com/assets/pdfs/3162.pdf) for more details about the training. Since few images are closed-eyes in the training data 300W-LP, the landmarks of eyes are not accurate when closing. The eyes part of the webcam demo are also not good.

2. Running on Windows.

    You can refer to [this comment](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2/issues/12#issuecomment-697479173) for building NMS on Windows.
